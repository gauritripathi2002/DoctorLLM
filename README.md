# DoctorLLM - Conversational Medical AI 

Welcome to the GitHub repository for DoctorGPT, a cutting-edge conversational AI developed by Gauri Tripathi and Sparsh Patel. DoctorGPT, fine-tuned on the Mistral model, is a virtual physician designed to provide accurate, nuanced, and respectful medical guidance.

## Project Overview

DoctorGPT was created using the Mistral model, a variant of the OpenAI GPT model, specifically trained for generating conversational responses in a medical context. The model, fine-tuned with conversational dialogues between patients and doctors, aims to replicate a real-life medical consultation experience.

### Key Features:

- **Advanced AI Model:** Built on `Mistral-7B`, a powerful model that can generate thoughtful and accurate medical advice.
- **High-Quality Interaction:** Ensures factual and nuanced communication, prioritizing user well-being and understanding.
- **Quantized for Efficiency:** Future enhancements include quantizing the model to 2, 4, and 8 bits for task-specific use cases, optimizing performance without compromising accuracy.

### Technologies Used:

- **Transformers & bitsandbytes:** For efficient model loading and processing.
- **Gradio:** For creating an interactive web interface for the AI model.
- **PyTorch & Accelerate:** For leveraging GPU capabilities and accelerating computations.

### Repository Contents:

- **Model Training and Fine-tuning Scripts:** Scripts used for training and fine-tuning the AI model on specific datasets.
- **Gradio Web Interface:** Code for the interactive web application where users can converse with DoctorGPT.
- **Supporting Libraries:** Includes Torch, Gradio, Transformers, and other necessary Python libraries.

### How to Run:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all required libraries installed (`torch`, `gradio`, `transformers`, `requests`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`, `tiktoken`, `einops`, `transformers_stream_generator`, `scipy`, `torchvision`, `tensorboard`, `matplotlib`, `bitsandbytes`, `optimum`, `auto-gptq`, `mdtex2html`, `packaging`, `ninja`).
3. Run the provided notebook or Python script to start the interactive web interface.
4. Interact with DoctorGPT through the Gradio web application.
